During the 1890s, as a young doctor collaborating with Viennese physician Josef Breuer, he began treating nervous disorders through the use of a 'talking cure,' as he and Breuer called it. The method initially consisted of patients under hypnosis recalling memories associated with their symptoms. This recall, accompanied by the affect connected with the memories, resulted in the elimination of symptoms. An early patient treated in this way, one Anna O., for example, who presented with paralyses and an inability to drink that lacked any organic base, regained her ability to drink when she recalled with disgust a scene from her childhood in which she had discovered her governess\u2019s dog drinking from a (human) cup.\n\nOn the basis of observations of this kind\u2014reported with Breuer in Studies on Hysteria (1895)\u2014Freud came to believe people are moved in part by mental forces unknown to them. The unconscious, as it came to be known, is composed mostly of thoughts and impressions people pushed from consciousness (or 'repressed') when they were very young. The thoughts and impressions linger in the mind and, unable to discharge, remain on alert for opportunities for expression. When they reach expression, they usually appear in disguise, so as not to elicit fresh repressions. The resulting manifestations include psychopathological symptoms, dreams, lapses of (conscious) speech or action (which Freud called 'parapraxes') such as slips of the tongue, and aspects of character, as well as a variety of ordinary individual and cultural experiences.""}, {""title"": ""BASIC ASSUMPTIONS"", ""content"": ""Freud\u2019s is a general psychological theory that attempts to explain why people think, feel, see, and do as they do. A systematic theory, it contains an integrated body of concepts and propositions from which other concepts and propositions follow. It builds from a small group of first principles, described by Freud as essential constituents of human thought and action that admit of no further reduction and yet account for all conceivable instances of human behavior. Based upon observation and reflection over the course of the forty-plus years spanned by his psychoanalytic writings, Freud eventually changed his ideas about these principles.\n\nInitially, Freud believed all human behavior conforms to what he called the pleasure (or pleasure-unpleasure) principle. According to the pleasure principle, people always strive to avoid pain and, where possible, attain pleasure. Even behavior that appears inconsistent with this principle, such as the nightmare, must in some way conform to it. Freud theorized in The Interpretation of Dreams (1900), for example, that nightmares serve to divert the dreamer from dangerous wishes whose fulfillment would produce frightening consequences. The fearsome content of the nightmare both embodies the dreamer\u2019s perception of danger\u2014such that, on occasion, the dreamer might awaken and thereby terminate the dream\u2014and serves to disguise the wish.\n\nFreud originally conceived the state of pleasure as a reduction in excitation, or tension, on the model of the reflex. Our reflexes, such as the eye-blink or knee-jerk reflex, function to rid the body of stimuli. Thus, at bottom, according to this initial conception, the function of the nervous system is to keep the level of stimulation in the body as low as possible, and pleasure is the consequence of the reduction. As happened with the governing principle itself, Freud changed his view of the nature of pleasure over the course of his writings.\n\nFreud believed that early in their development, in order to survive, humans would have to have formed a reality principle subordinate to the pleasure principle. Although the hallucinated satisfaction of one\u2019s needs, which would constitute the shortest path to their fulfillment, might produce pleasure in the short term, for example, it would lead to ultimate disappointment. Thus, Freud says in his 'Formulations Regarding Two Principles in Mental Functioning' (1911), the mind had to 'decide' to form a conception of circumstances in the real outer world, so as to be able to alter them and bring about real satisfaction.\n\nWhereas the pleasure principle operates reflexively from birth, the reality principle develops over time in the individual, according to Freud, and likewise developed in the evolution of the species. The reality principle, in turn, would have prompted further developments of the mind, beyond reflexive, or direct wish-fulfilling, functioning. Attention would have given individuals the ability to search their environment for the results of their actions; memory would have given them a means of notating and storing the results; thought would have arisen as a kind of experimental action, allowing individuals to test the (real) consequences of their behavior.""}, {""title"": ""CONSEQUENCES OF THE ASSUMPTIONS"", ""content"": ""Many of the remaining portions of Freud\u2019s theory follow from the foregoing primitives of mental life and particularly from the pleasure and reality principles, which Freud continued to believe dominate mental life even after he developed the scheme that incorporates the death instinct.\n\nMeaning and Determinism One such result is the idea that all behavior, including the most apparently nonsensical, has a reason, or, as Freud says in his Introductory Lectures on Psychoanalysis (1917) with respect to psychopathological symptoms in particular, symptoms have a sense. Anna O.\u2019s refusal to drink resulted from her (unconscious) disgust at her governess\u2019s dog, according to Breuer and Freud. Given that people who feel revolted by something normally find it difficult to eat or drink, Anna O.\u2019s behavior followed coherently from its source. Unlike healthy people who refuse food or drink because they feel revolted, however, Anna O. was unaware of both her disgust and its source. Therein lay her pathology. In conceiving dreams as wish fulfillments and parapraxes as products of concealed motives, Freud again followed the assumption that all behavior has a source and a sense. He believed it possible, moreover, for unconsciously motivated behavior, such as dreams, to have not just one source or one meaning, but to be 'overdetermined,' having multiple sources and meanings. Thus, for instance, the leering monster in a nightmare might embody both a child\u2019s anger at a parent and the child\u2019s fear of recriminations from the parent.\n\nFreud admitted that some apparently odd behavior arises without apparent motivation. However, he found the occurrence of such behavior improbable. Freud noted in Five Lectures on Psychoanalysis (1909) that although some aberrations, such as slips of the tongue, might occur when people operate under fatigue or other stresses, the mistakes cannot be caused by these limitations, because other similar mistakes occur when people are fully attentive (p. 29). Further, precisely because numerous associative pathways lie open and can cause a person accidentally to utter one word instead of another (in the case of slips of the tongue), one needs to explain why a given pathway is chosen on a given occasion.""}]}",https://app.skyvern.com/workflows/wpid_387041531689904866/wr_387041531689904868/overview,Success,The bot has completed the task

There are few books where the beginning paragraphs hit a home run for me, and this is one of them. It has been a long month filled with family time and endless cooking so for the last ten days I opted for comfort reads and there is no family who provides comfort like the Finches, with the exception of Aunt Alexandra. \u201cLawyers were children once,\u201d quotes Charles Lamb in the opening epithet. Prior to this reading, I viewed Atticus Finch as an unapproachable, older father. Beloved by his children to the point of idolization, but with an impenetrable outer skin. As an adult looking back at the events which shaped the novel, Scout paints the picture of her father as one who makes everything right and makes her feel safe. Even though this novel had been marketed for adults, it is in its essence a coming of age novel, which shows Scout\u2019s growth through elementary school while her family faces events that mean to alter the history of a town. Atticus would need to be a strong figure to guide his children through the plot, and he would need to wistfully remember his childhood in order to relate to them. This is the man who told us all to walk in another\u2019s shoes and see things from their point of view. Until today, I never viewed Atticus as multi-faceted, just a great man.

I am aware that some of my criticism is not a critique of the book itself, but about its perception, and how it is, up to this day, held up as the one true book about race relations in the United States of America. And that really infuriates me. This book was written by a white woman, from a white perspective, about white characters, for a white audience.

A state may punish a certain crime more harshly than the federal government (or vice versa), but a defendant can be charged and convicted under both systems.\n\nThe federal rules for criminal cases can be found in the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, which govern all aspects of criminal trials.

The drinks are unique and hand crafted. The wine menu is top-notch, and if you do the pairing with the tasting menus, you cannot go wrong.

That was their first major test and this is the next one. They couldn't have asked for a better time than now to play Arsenal. If Arsenal lose this game, they are out of the title race!\n\nPeople can go like, 'Oh, there are 29 games left' and all that. But if they lose, it's a six-point gap with Manchester City. How can you expect City to lose ground on that advantage and expect Arsenal to win all their remaining games at the same time? With Liverpool also in the title race, you're chasing two teams now and neither of them look like losing at the moment.\n\nArsenal suffered back-to-back games against Fulham and West Ham in gameweeks 19 and 20 respectively last season and they ended up losing the title. That really cost them and Mikel Arteta will know his team must avoid another loss here. They also have so many key players injured. Bukayo Saka may not be ready, Martin Odegaard is definitely out and William Saliba is suspended. Let's not forget Riccardo Calafiori also picked up an injury.\n\nIf you're Liverpool, you could accept a draw but deep down inside, they'll still be disappointed if they fail to win this game. If it was still Jurgen Klopp as manager, I could see Liverpool running riot here and Arsenal getting shredded to pieces with so many of their key players unavailable. Klopp always wanted to leave teams with a bloody nose in games like these, whereas Arne Slot is more controlled.\n\nI like Caoimhin Kelleher, he's a good goalkeeper. He looks composed and never lets Liverpool down. He's always ready to play even when chances are so limited due to Alisson being one of the top goalkeepers in the world. I also think Luis Diaz will join Mohamed Salah and Darwin Nunez as part of the front-three instead of Cody Gakpo.\n\nThere's obviously this question around who plays for Arsenal if Saka isn't fit and I think it should be Raheem Sterling against Andy Robertson. But I don't think that will necessarily happen because Leandro Trossard has a knack of scoring against Liverpool and could fit perfectly into the Gunners' counter-attacking threat.\n\nArsenal will be without three of their four best players, with Declan Rice being the only exception. Liverpool will know these kind of opportunities to face a weakened Arsenal team will not come around very often. But I doubt they'll get a win. A draw in the end would be a great result for Arsenal."", ""prediction"": ""Arsenal 1-1 Liverpool""}}",https://app.skyvern.com/workflows/wpid_388786679464752552/wr_388786679464752558/overview,Success,The bot successfully completed the task

In doing so, they look to secure our freedom, no matter what science or theoretical reason reveals about us. This paper lays out two problems for this position. The problems are both metaphysical and epistemic. The metaphysical issues are that conceiving of freedom as an idea or presupposition that we must adopt from the practical standpoint makes it especially difficult to account for interaction between freedom and experience, but also why some things occupy a practical standpoint where others do not. The epistemic issue is that the standpoint view struggles to account for knowledge of freedom in experience. I contend that these problems are decisive, and that we should abandon the standpoint view of freedom.""}",https://app.skyvern.com/workflows/wpid_388786686232510256/wr_388786686232510262/overview,Success,The bot successfully completed the task

Verify Boot Order: Enter your BIOS/UEFI settings (usually by pressing F2, F10, DEL, or ESC during startup) and ensure your primary hard drive is set as the first boot device.\n\n2. Check for GRUB Errors: If you see a GRUB error, boot from a live Ubuntu USB, open a terminal, and run 'sudo update-grub' to regenerate the boot menu.\n\n3. Repair Bootloader: If GRUB is missing or corrupted, use the live USB to run 'sudo grub-install /dev/sdX' (replace sdX with your boot drive, e.g., sda).\n\n4. Check Disk Health: Use 'fsck' from a live session to check and repair disk errors. For example, 'sudo fsck /dev/sdXn' (replace sdXn with your root partition).\n\n5. Kernel Parameters: If the system hangs during boot, try editing the boot parameters (press 'e' at the GRUB menu) and add 'nomodeset' or other relevant parameters.\n\n6. Review Logs: Use 'journalctl' or 'dmesg' from a live session to review system logs for errors that may indicate hardware or driver issues.\n\n7.

After age 30, both men and women lose 3\u20138% of muscle mass per decade, with the rate accelerating after 60, and menopause further exacerbates muscle and bone loss in women. Regular strength training not only combats this decline but also increases bone density, boosts metabolism, improves functional fitness, and can add years to life. A study cited found women who strength trained 2-3 times per week were 30% less likely to die from heart disease. The article introduces a 31-day plan designed to help women make strength training a consistent habit, while also incorporating walking, yoga, mobility, and stretching for a well-rounded routine. The plan aims to improve both physical and mental health, addressing aches, pains, mobility, stress, and tension. Tips for beginners include starting slow with bodyweight exercises, focusing on foundational movements (like squats, pushups, deadlifts, rows, bench and overhead presses, and planks), choosing enjoyable activities, and being patient and consistent. For women 50+, the article provides a full-body strength routine using heavy weights and low reps, structured in supersets for efficiency. The overall advice is to prioritize strength training, adapt routines as you age (including more recovery and flexibility work), and maintain consistency for long-term health and longevity.""}]}",https://app.skyvern.com/workflows///overview,Success,The bot successfully completed the task

A Santa Barbara County Fire Department dozer was able to clear a path to the camp, and the children escaped. During the incident, the NWS Weather Forecast Office Los Angeles/Oxnard provided critical fire weather forecast information to help the local emergency managers conduct the operation as safely as possible. During the evening of the event the NWS provided several written forecasts focusing specifically on that fire, as well as being in verbal contact to provide updates. In addition to this event, the NWS provided another heads up to an approaching wind event 24 hours later, allowing the Los Padres National Forest to send a one-hour alert to the firefighters. The firefighters later reported that winds had been quite erratic during the event and how much they appreciated the heads up. 'Thanks to all of the local Santa Barbara County emergency managers and first responders for their hard work managing the Whittier Fire and ensuring the safety of their citizens,' said NWS Director Dr. Louis Uccellini.

Ofrece una experiencia de juego casi id\u00e9ntica a la de PC o consolas. Los controles son altamente personalizables, permitiendo ajustar el tama\u00f1o y posici\u00f3n de botones, elegir modelos de control para veh\u00edculos, y usar el aceler\u00f3metro o gatillos f\u00edsicos si el dispositivo los tiene. El juego soporta crossplay, pero limita a los jugadores de Android e iOS a jugar entre s\u00ed, manteniendo a los jugadores de PC, consola y emulador en servidores separados para asegurar igualdad de condiciones. El modo principal es el battle royale tradicional donde 100 jugadores se lanzan en paraca\u00eddas a una isla, buscan armas y equipo, y luchan por ser el \u00faltimo superviviente mientras una zona segura se reduce. Este modo se puede jugar en solitario, d\u00fao o escuadrones de cuatro. Adem\u00e1s, PUBG MOBILE incluye modos adicionales como deathmatchs cl\u00e1sicos (5v5) y mapas m\u00e1s peque\u00f1os (como Karakin o Sanhok) para partidas m\u00e1s r\u00e1pidas. El juego se mantiene fresco con eventos especiales mensuales, que a menudo incluyen colaboraciones exclusivas (ej. Blackpink, Godzilla, King Kong, Messi) ofreciendo skins y modos de juego por tiempo limitado. Los jugadores pueden ganar monedas en las partidas para desbloquear cajas de recompensas (loot boxes) que contienen equipo, armas y skins \u00fanicas; tambi\u00e9n existen cajas exclusivas de socios como Xiaomi o POCO. Visualmente, el juego permite una personalizaci\u00f3n gr\u00e1fica detallada, ajustando la calidad de texturas, tasa de frames por segundo, antialiasing y aplicando filtros visuales para optimizar la experiencia seg\u00fan el dispositivo y las preferencias del jugador."", ""technical_specifications"": {""package_name"": ""com.tencent.ig"", ""license"": ""Gratis"", ""operating_system"": ""Android"", ""category"": ""Acci\u00f3n y Aventuras"", ""language"": ""Espa\u00f1ol y 10 m\u00e1s"", ""author"": ""Tencent PUBG"", ""downloads"": ""221,388,185"", ""release_date"": ""7 mar. 2025"", ""content_rating"": ""+16"", ""advertising"": ""No especificado"", ""why_published_on_uptodown"": ""(M\u00e1s informaci\u00f3n)""}, ""recent_versions"": [{""version"": ""3.7.0"", ""release_date"": ""7 mar. 2025""}, {""version"": ""3.6.0"", ""release_date"": ""9 ene. 2025""}]}",https://app.skyvern.com/workflows/wpid_388787016438915116/wr_388787016438915122/overview,Success,The bot has completed the task successfully
